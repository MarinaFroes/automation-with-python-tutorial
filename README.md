I created this project by following the [Python Tutorial - Python for Beginners - Learn Python Programming [2020]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) video by Mosh.

## Overview

This small project creates a workbook from an excel spreadsheet and calculates a new price based on the existing prices on the table. Then it generates a chart based on the new calculated prices.
